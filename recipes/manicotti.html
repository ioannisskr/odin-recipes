  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This manicotti recipe makes a comforting dinner your family will love.

  <p>“Manicotti” (which means, literally, “little sleeves”) can refer to both a pasta shape 
    and an Italian dish. Manicotti shells are large, tubular, and intended to be stuffed. 
    Traditionally, manicotti is stuffed with a cheese mixture and baked in a tomato sauce.</p>

    <li>8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
